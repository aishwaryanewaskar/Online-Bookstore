I have developed an Online Bookstore project, a full-stack web application designed to simplify the process of buying, selling, 
and managing books online. It provides a user-friendly interface for customers to browse books, make secure purchases, and access 
features like e-books and audiobooks. For administrators, it offers efficient tools for managing inventory, orders, and customer
data, ensuring smooth operations and scalability.
